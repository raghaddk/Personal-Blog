            do meaningful work, enjoy a career, and achieve financial independence. Everyone wants to make a difference in 
            the world, to be significant, to have a positive impact on those around him or her. 
            Everyone wants to do something wonderful with his or her life.</p>
            <p>If you can follow these tips, you will be able to take control of your life and achieve your goals.</p>
       
            <h3 id="h-one">We All Have One Common Goal</h3>
            <p>Luckily for most of us, personal success is not a matter of background, intelligence, or native ability. 
            It’s not our family, friends, or contacts who enable us to do extraordinary things. Instead, 
            the keys to success in life are our ability to get the very best out of ourselves under almost all 
            conditions and circumstances. It is your ability to adapt and change your life.</p>
            <p>You have within you, right now, deep reserves of potential and ability that, if properly harnessed and channeled, 
            will enable you to accomplish extraordinary things with your life.</p>

            <h3 id="h-one">The Four Keys To Success</h3>
            <p>The great keys to success to change your life have always been the same.</p>
            <p>1- Decide exactly what you want and where you want to go.<br>
            2- Set a deadline and make a plan to get there. (Remember, a goal is just a dream with a deadline.)<br>
            3- Take action on your plan; do something every day to move toward your goal.<br>
            4- Resolve in advance that you will persist until you succeed, that you will never, ever give up.</p>

            <h3 id="h-one"> How To Be Successful From The Experts To Change Your Life</h3>
            <p>You will not live long enough to figure it all out for yourself. And what a waste it would be to try, 
            when you can learn from others who have gone before. In one of many great quotes, Ben Franklin said, 
            <em>“Men can either buy their wisdom or they can borrow it from others. The great tragedy is that most men 
            prefer to buy it, to pay full price in terms of time and treasure.”</em></p>
            <p>Your greatest goal in life and in personal success should be to acquire as many of them as possible 
            and then use them to help you do the things you want to do and become the person you want to become.</p>
            <p id="underline"><strong>For example:</strong></p><br>
            <p>If you want to learn how to write a book, you can follow a step-by-step process created by a bestselling author. 
            Learn from their mistakes and benefit from their systems by following their
